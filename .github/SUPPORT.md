# Have a bug to report or a feature request?

If you think you have found a bug in hyperhelp or you have an idea for a new
feature, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/hyperhelpcore/issues)
on the issue tracker to let us know.

When reporting bugs, it helps to know what version of Sublime Text you're
using, what operating system you're on, and what version of hyperhelp you are
using.

You can determine the version of Sublime Text you're using via the `About`
command in the command palette. To determine the version of hyperhelp you're
using, check for a line similar to the following in the Sublime Text console:

    plugins loaded
    hyperhelp: hyperhelpcore 0.0.1 up to date
