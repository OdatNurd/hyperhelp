This is an extremely simple prototype of a help system that could be implemented
within a package to provide interactive, hyper linked help. If you're a student
of the text editing sciences, you may recognize the help format as being very
loosely based on the system used in vim.

Links are created by using text within asterisks or single quotes to mark the
destination of the link. Text within vertical pipe characters (|) creates a link
that jumps back to that target.

An example of a target in asterisks is the first thing in this help file up in
the header, while an example of using single quotes would look like 'this'.

A link that would jump back to the header for this file would be |index.txt|,
while a link that jumps back to the previous paragraph would look like |this|.

You can follow either link by pressing <Enter> while the cursor is on it or by
<Double Clicking> on it. Go ahead and try it!

Just as an aside, it's also possible to create a link to an external web site,
such as this incredibly shameless plug for a package of mine called
|OverrideAudit|.

| Help Keys |
+-----------+

While viewing help, the following key bindings are active to allow you to
interact with the help. Since the help is just a regular text view, you can also
navigate through the files as you normally would.

    <?>                      View the Table of Contents
    <Enter>/<Double Click>   Follow a link
    <Tab>/<Shift+Tab>        Skip between the next or previous link
