*index.txt*                    A Sample Help file                    May 3, 2017
================================================================================

A simple help file format. Any text inside of two asterisks represents the
*target* of a link.

Another way to do the same thing is via single quotes, which works the same but
is syntax highlighted differently to indicate that it is an 'option' instead of
a general help target.

Possibly you might want to talk about a key binding, in which case you can do
something like this:

    Press <Alt+O> or <super+Shift+Up> to swap between overrides and their diffs

Just because it's cool, you can also do markdown style `code blocks` for that
extra little bit of emphasis.

Since there are some link targets, you might want to actually follow them. You
can create a link to a target with pipes. So for example |index.txt| jumps to
the header of file, while |target| jumps to that target and |option| jumps to
the option target.

It's also possible to jump to another file, for example |other.txt|.
