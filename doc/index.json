    // of the distinct help files or external web sites being linked
    // to and the values are arrays of all of the topics contained
    // within that file.
    //
    // Each topic in the list can be either just the topic itself
    // (which is the target contained in the help files themselves) or
    // they can be a dictionary with the following keys:
    //    "topic": the actual topic
    //    "caption": the caption to use in the TOV list
    //
    // When an entry is just a topic, it is expanded to a dictionary
    // like the above, with the caption being a duplicate of the
    // topic. Generally speaking only topics that appear in the table
    // of contents need a caption.

    // that all of the help targets in each file are properly listed,
    // as the user will be unable to navigate to a target if it is not
    // in the list.
    //
    // Note also that at load time the file is flipped "inside out"
    // into a dictionary with topics and keys, which means that topics
    // must be unique throughout the help system. This is due to the
    // link syntax not providing any context for where the link
    // actually goes.
