    // This is the table of contents file for the HyperHelp demo.
    //
    // This special key specifies the list of topics that should be
    // displayed when the table of contents of the help is displayed,
    // and also sets the order of their display.
    //
    // This key is optional; if it is not here, it is synthesized by
    // collecting the list of all other keys in the dictionary and
    // sorting them.
    "__toc": ["index.txt", "other.txt"],

    // In this dictionary object, the keys are the names of all of
    // the distinct help files and the values are a list of all of
    // the topics contained within that help file.
    //
    // In the list of topics, the topics themselves can be just the
    // topic string itself (the target that the help topic will
    // jump to in the file) or it can be a dictionary with the
    // following keys:
    //    topic: the actual topic
    //    caption: the caption to use in the TOV list
    //
    // Entries that are just strings are expanded to be dictionaries
    // in which the topic and caption are both the topic string. In
    // general you only need to specify the dict version of a target
    // when it will appear in the table of contents and you want to
    // dress it up.
    //
    // The onus is on the developer to ensure that all of the help
    // targets in each file are properly listed, as the user will
    // be unable to navigate to a target if it's not in the list.
    //
    // Some checking is done at initialization time to ensure that
    // topic dictionaries (where they are used) contain at least
    // the topic key; if the caption key is missing, it will be
    // synthesized.
