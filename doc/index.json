    // of the distinct help files or external web sites being linked
    // to and the values are arrays of all of the topics contained
    // within that file.

    // If there is only going to be a single target in the help file,
    // as a shorthand you can specify it directly as the value without
    // having to wrap it in an array.

    // Additionally, specifying a value of true for a help file will
    // create a single implicit topic with the same name as the
    // help file, allowing you to easily link to external files and
    // URL's with their full names.

    // When a list of topics is provided, each topic in the list can
    // be either just the topic itself (which is the target contained
    // in the help files themselves) or they can be a dictionary with

    //    "topic": the actual topic
    //    "caption": the caption to use in the TOC list
    //
    // When an entry is just a topic, it is expanded to a dictionary
    // like the above, with the caption being a duplicate of the
    // topic. Generally speaking only topics that appear in the table
    // of contents need a caption, and the caption is only used if you
    // do not specify your own specify your own __toc key (see above).

    // In this demonstration, the onus is on the developer to ensure
    // that all of the help targets in each file are properly listed,
    // as the user will be unable to navigate to a target if it is not
    // in the list.
    //
    // Note also that at load time the file is flipped "inside out"
    // into a dictionary with topics and keys, which means that topics
    // must be unique throughout the help system. This is due to the
    // link syntax not providing any context for where the link
    // actually goes.
