## _none:Version 0.0.5 (2019-03-31)
-------------------------------

  * Include a command to display the package version of the bootstrapped
    package and of the dependency in preparation for the initial public
    announcement on April 1.


## _none:Version 0.0.4 (2019-03-27)
-----------------------------

  * Bump the internal version number which was accidentally skipped from the
    0.0.3 release, stopping existing installs from seeing the changes.


## _none:Version 0.0.3 (2019-03-25)
-----------------------------

  * Enhance key contexts used in key bindings

  * Ensure that when the history index panel is opened, the current help item
    is initially selected.

  * While post processing, removal of comments would also remove comments from
    in-line code blocks; this has been fixed.

  * Rewrite the internal help to be more up to date with how the package has
    been rewritten in the last year.


## _none:Version 0.0.2 (2019-03-07)
-----------------------------

  * Watch `ignored_packages` to determine when packages are being ignored or
    unignored and load or drop their indexes as needed to keep help in sync
    with packages.

  * Fix a bug in bootstrapping that would block it from happening if the
    package was unpacked.


## _none:Version 0.0.1 (2019-02-17)
-----------------------------

  * Initial release
